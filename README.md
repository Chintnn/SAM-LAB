# Arduino Sensor Projects Index

## Overview  
This repository contains basic Arduino projects utilizing various sensors. Each project demonstrates how to interface a specific sensor with an Arduino board.

## Projects  
### 1. Basic LED Blinking  
- **Description**: A simple LED blinking project where two LEDs alternate states every second.  
- **File**: [Basic LED Blinking](Basics/Basic.md)  

### 2. DHT11 Temperature and Humidity Sensor  
- **Description**: Uses a DHT11 sensor to measure temperature and humidity and displays values on a serial monitor.  
- **File**: [DHT11 Sensor](Temp/Temp.md)
  
### 3. IR Sensor for Object Detection  
- **Description**: Uses an infrared sensor to detect objects and trigger an LED and buzzer.  
- **File**: [IR Sensor](IR/IR.md)

### 4. PIR Motion Sensor with LED and Buzzer  
- **Description**: Uses a PIR (Passive Infrared) sensor to detect motion and trigger an LED and a buzzer.  
- **File**: [PIR Sensor](PIR/PIR.md)  

### 5. Ultrasonic Sensor with LED Indicators  
- **Description**: Measures distance using an ultrasonic sensor and lights up different LEDs based on detected distance.  
- **File**: [Ultrasonic Sensor](UltraSonic/UltraSonic.md)
