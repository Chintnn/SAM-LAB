# Ultrasonic Sensor with LED Indicators  

## Overview  
This project uses an ultrasonic sensor to measure distance. Based on the detected distance, different LEDs (blue, white, yellow) are activated.  

## Components  
- Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04)  
- Blue LED  
- White LED  
- Yellow LED  
- Arduino

## Working  
- **Distance ≤ 10 cm** → Blue LED turns ON.  
- **10 cm < Distance ≤ 20 cm** → White LED turns ON.  
- **Distance > 20 cm** → Yellow LED turns ON.
