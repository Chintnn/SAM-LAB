# PIR Motion Sensor with LED and Buzzer

## Overview  
This project uses a PIR (Passive Infrared) sensor to detect motion. When an object is detected, an LED and a buzzer are activated.  

## Components  
- PIR Sensor  
- LED  
- Buzzer  
- Arduino

## Components  
- **When no motion is detected** → LED & buzzer remain OFF.  
- **When motion is detected** → LED & buzzer turn ON.
