# LED Blinking System

## Overview  
This project demonstrates a simple LED blinking system using an Arduino. Two LEDs alternate states, turning one on while the other is off, with a delay of one second.

## Components  
- Arduino Board  
- LED (Pin 13)  
- LED (Pin 10)  
- Resistors  
- Connecting Wires

## Working  
- **LED on Pin 13 ON, LED on Pin 10 OFF**  
- **After 1 second: LED on Pin 13 OFF, LED on Pin 10 ON**  
- **Process repeats continuously**
